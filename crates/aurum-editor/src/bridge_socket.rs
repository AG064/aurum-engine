//! The editor bridge's socket transport.
//!
//! The file pump works, and polling a directory every frame is a strange way to
//! talk to a program that is already running. A socket is the ordinary answer:
//! no shared directory to agree on, no per-frame filesystem scan, and a caller
//! that is not on this machine's filesystem conventions can still connect.
//!
//! ## The threading, which is the whole difficulty
//!
//! Godot's scene tree is not thread-safe, so [`AurumEditor::handle_request`]
//! must run on the main thread. Accepting connections and reading from them
//! must *not*: a client that connects and then says nothing would otherwise
//! freeze the editor.
//!
//! So the work is split. A background thread accepts connections and reads
//! requests; each request is posted to a queue and its connection thread waits
//! for an answer; the main thread drains that queue once a frame, runs the
//! request against the scene, and hands the answer back. Nothing but the queue
//! is shared, and the queue holds data rather than behaviour.
//!
//! ## What a caller has to prove
//!
//! A socket is reachable by every process on the machine, so every request
//! carries the session token the launcher passed in the environment, compared
//! without leaking where a wrong guess first diverges. The listener is also
//! bound to `127.0.0.1` and cannot be configured otherwise, because that is the
//! difference between a local tool and an open door.
