//! Restarting the game without restarting the editor.
//!
//! Three of the four verdicts cost no process. `NoAction` costs nothing,
//! `Reload` is Godot's own business, and an `EditorRestart` is the user's
//! decision — the design is explicit that Studio asks before taking one, and
//! never takes it while work is unsaved. The fourth, `GameplayRestart`, is the
//! one a session acts on by itself: a change that invalidates live scene
//! instances is answered by stopping the game this session launched and
//! starting it again.
//!
//! Nothing reachable from here can touch an editor, and that is the point of
//! the module. "The editor stays alive through a gameplay restart" is a
//! property of the types rather than a promise in a comment, because no
//! function below is ever given an editor process to stop.
