//! The supervisor: typed commands in, bounded events out.
//!
//! The design requires that "the UI thread never waits for builds, file
//! operations, or child processes", with "a supervisor worker owning
//! asynchronous work and sending bounded events". This is that worker.
//!
//! It exists ahead of any particular UI on purpose. Whatever the shell turns
//! out to be — a window, a page, a terminal — it needs the same two things: a
//! way to ask for work without blocking, and a stream of what happened. The CLI
//! and any future shell are adapters over this, not implementations of it.
//!
//! ## Why the queue is bounded, and what gets dropped
//!
//! A build produces far more log lines than a person can read, and an
//! unbounded queue would grow without limit if nobody is draining it. So the
//! queue has a capacity, and when it is full the **oldest droppable** event is
//! discarded.
//!
//! Not every event is droppable. Losing a log line costs a little history;
//! losing `BuildFinished` would leave a caller waiting forever for a result
//! that already happened, and losing `ProcessStopped` would leave a window
//! claiming something is running that is not. Events that carry state are
//! never dropped, and the consumer can ask how many were.
