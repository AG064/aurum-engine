//! Launching and stopping the processes a session owns.
//!
//! Two rules shape everything here.
//!
//! **Only what Studio launched is ever stopped.** A stop request checks the
//! ownership record against the live process first, and refuses on any
//! mismatch, so a recycled identifier cannot turn `aurum stop` into a way to
//! kill something unrelated.
//!
//! **Unsaved work is never discarded.** A normal stop asks the process to
//! close and waits. If it is still running afterwards, that is reported and
//! the decision goes back to the user rather than escalating to a kill on its
//! own.
