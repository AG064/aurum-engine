//! Building the native extension and installing it safely.
//!
//! The guarantee this module exists to provide is narrow and absolute: **a
//! failed build never damages the working extension.** Everything is ordered
//! around that. Cargo runs, the artifact is waited on until it stops changing,
//! it is hashed and staged *inside the destination directory*, and only then
//! is the installed library swapped. Any failure before the swap leaves the
//! destination byte-identical to what it was.
//!
//! Installed sources are never touched, and Godot is never terminated to win a
//! file lock. A locked library is a bounded, reported failure with a remedy,
//! because killing the editor to force a copy would discard the user's work to
//! save a retry.
