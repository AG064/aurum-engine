# Contributing to Aurum

Thanks for your interest in Aurum. This guide covers the basics of
contributing, the code style, and how to add new modules.

## Code of conduct

Be kind, assume good faith, focus on the work. We're all here to make
games.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for any non-trivial change. Module additions,
   engine API changes, anything that affects the public surface — discuss
   it before writing code.
2. **Fork the repo** and create a branch from `main`.
3. **Write code + tests.** No PR without tests for new behavior.
4. **Run the checks locally:**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
5. **Open a PR** with a clear description of what changed and why.

## Code style

### Rust

- `rustfmt` default style. No custom rules.
- `clippy` clean. No `#[allow(...)]` without a comment explaining why.
- Public API gets a doc comment. Examples in the doc comments are
  exercised by doc tests where possible.
- Errors via `thiserror`; no `anyhow` in library code.
- No `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment.

### GDScript

- Tabs for indentation (Godot's default).
- `class_name` only for files meant to be referenced globally. Module
  internals stay private.
- Type hints on function signatures.
- No `print` in shipped game code; use a logging helper or the dev
  console. `print` is fine in demos and the dev console itself.

## Module contract

When you add a new module:

1. Create a crate at `crates/aurum-<name>/` with the same shape as the
   existing modules (`Cargo.toml` + `src/lib.rs` + tests).
2. Add the crate to the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
3. Define component types with `Serialize` + `Deserialize` so save/load
   works.
4. Add a doc comment block at the top of `lib.rs` listing the component
   names and field shapes (this is the contract with GDScript).
5. (Optional) Add a GDScript shim under
   `godot/addons/aurum/scripts/aurum_<name>.gd` if GDScript code
   needs to use the module's components.
6. Add a demo under `godot/demos/<name>/` if the module is
   visual or interactive.
7. Add a starter template under `godot/templates/<name>/` that
   other projects can copy.

The component-name contract is: a Rust component called `"Foo"` has
the same name in GDScript, with the same field names, in the same
shape. Mismatches silently drop fields, so be strict.

## Releasing

The maintainer cuts releases. The current version lives in each
crate's `Cargo.toml` (kept in sync via the workspace `version` field).
The GDExtension DLL is uploaded as a build artifact on tagged commits.
